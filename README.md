## Code Explanation
HTML: The HTML structure includes a table with buttons for digits, operators, and control functions like clear and evaluate.

JavaScript :The main function appends the clicked button value to the screen display.

The calculate function evaluates the expression displayed on the screen using the eval function, and handles errors gracefully by displaying Error.

## Conclusion

This calculator is a basic implementation intended for learning purposes. Users can enhance it by adding more features like keyboard support, scientific functions, and improved styling.
